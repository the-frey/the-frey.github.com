Hello, my name is Alex and I'm currently working on my first fully bespoke web app. I also do all the sort of things you'd expect - PHP, jQuery, Wordpress etc., so I may blog about those projects from time to time as well. Basically this is a place away from the more 'client facing' blogs I keep elsewhere on music journalism and web work, somewhere where I can put more 'technical' project notes and that. Enjoy!

NB: This page is built using <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>. I've left in the intro below (bottom post) in case you're curious.
