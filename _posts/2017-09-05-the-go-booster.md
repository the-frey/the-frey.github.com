I use a modified Space Echo preamp in a lot of my pedal designs. It's a great utility circuit and I've gotten tired of trying to explain why it's cool - so here you go, build it for yourself and see what all the fuss is about.

It's open-source and you can [find the project files here](https://github.com/the-frey/go-booster).

If you did use it and enjoy it, then give me a shout!
