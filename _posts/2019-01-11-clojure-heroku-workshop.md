## Setting up an editor

Obviously, emacs is preferred. However, if attendees don't have emacs and nREPL/Cider, then Atom with ProtoREPL is probably your best bet. However, probably you're mainly going to have folks on VS Code.

### Notes for setting up VS Code

We had some issues with VS Code. Here's a blog post, and the plugin that eventually worked for us.
