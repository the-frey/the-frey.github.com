This blog is at least partly just a scratchpad for myself, so with that in mind - I recently saw a somewhat [old, but very good talk about streaming at Netflix](https://youtu.be/WuRazsX-MBY). Obviously the mind boggles at the numbers presented, but their service pattern was one of the more interesting parts of the talk.

Either way, it was interesting enough that I felt compelled to write a few notes.

Obviously I don't work at Netflix, so if you've landed via Google - sorry about that, watch the video above if you're interested in what they were doing in 2016, or blast through the notes below.

I really like the idea of "paved path" and "off road" - I guess I've heard similar terms used in different situations - but that's definitely one I'll be using at some point.

Bonus points - you have read about [DevOps Topologies](https://web.devopstopologies.com/), right?
