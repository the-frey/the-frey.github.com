I started this blog with the intention of posting more frequently, but apparently I've completely failed at sticking to anything approaching a regular update schedule. I could blame it on a number of things, and, well, _I will_:

1. I've recently got a post-rock column in Prog magazine.
2. I've completed the new SSD website (though it's not yet live) - I think the members area will morph into a singles club of some kind when I have the money/motivation. Other than that it's a standard Rails site with user area. Take a look [here](http://ssd-dev.herokuapp.com).
3. I've revised the [Cyril Snear](http://www.cyrilsnear.com) site so it's now maybe something like 0.9.2 of Canvass if I was doing version numbers in a thought-out way. As it turns out, from having made Wordpress sites for bands since, some of the most asked-for pieces are actually a part of that CMS, which is cool. I'm just not sure I realised at any point how much control over things that I consider unnecessary bands would want to have... but then that's an artist's perogative I suppose. Either way, it's been an interesting learning experience. 
4. The Lit & Phil site is complete, but as with all client work it's currently if not in development hell then development purgatory. Hopefully it'll see the light of day next month. Every time I crawl around in the code I feel like I can see how far I've come since then but oh well, I suppose that can only be a good thing. 
5. I've read a book on typography and several on design, filled two notebooks with jottings, read Crockford's _JavaScript: The Good Parts_ and Hartl's _Rails Tutorial_ (bloody ace, incidentally).
6. Put together sites for [Alpha Male Tea Party](http://www.alphamaleteaparty.com), [Ninetails](http://www.ninetailsband.co.uk) and our label's most reliable artistic advisor [Ben Murphy](http://www.benjaminmurphy.info/). I've had to learn to put my opinions a little bit to one side and go with what other people would prefer, which has given me a new respect for both front-end devs and designers... at least with the back-end your code runs or it doesn't. 

So what next? Well, I want to take a look at Refinery CMS for Rails, do some of the more general Udacity CS courses, do something on Assembly Language (thinking of [this](http://programminggroundup.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/chapter-1-introduction.html)) to get a better idea of deeper system stuff, and then get to grips with Backbone.js... with programming it's sometimes hard to see the wood for the trees with all of the possible things you can learn, but I think at the moment I'm increasingly feeling pretty good about where I am.
