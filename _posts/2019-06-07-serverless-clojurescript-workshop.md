At May's Lambda Lounge, I ran a workshop for getting up to speed with the Serverless framework, clojurescript and AWS. There's a lot of moving parts!

People had asked if I could post the instructions, so I thought I'd stick them here.

I'm going to keep the Gist for the session updated, so I'll just link the whole thing:
