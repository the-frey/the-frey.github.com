Very interesting time at this. Highlights from Shopify and Yelp, with some interesting insights on radical change from Commercetest.

Some random highlights:

Shopify - 

> The team is 3 people, with about two people to set it up.

Yelp -

> Kafka hidden by [a schema] registry. You register a schema and then you get topic info and access.

Commercetest - 

> Code was written in the open as open-source code on GitHub and then pulled into corporate environments as needed to then productionize. Developing and testing in the open removed governance blockages.
