Saw the other day that the video of my talk _Zen and the Art of Tube Amp Maintenance_ was up on YouTube, so thought I'd post a link.

The notes are posted on this blog elsewhere, but I'll flatter myself that the talk itself is a bit more coherent if you just watch it:

[![NWRUG Talk](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Ns-5ijAuFDY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns-5ijAuFDY "NWRUG Talk")

It has quite a few gifs, so that's something to enjoy, if nothing else.
